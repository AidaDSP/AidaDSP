- Available open source low level libraries for Arduino Uno/Mega/Due/Zero

### How it works

DSP firmware is developed in Sigma Studio, a intuitive graphical design tool. From Sigma Studio you can generate an .xml file which contains DSP firmware and then with our [Java tool](https://github.com/AidaDSP/AidaDSP/tree/master/Software/Java/AidaHeaderFileGenerator/bin) you can generate a C header file to be used in the Arduino IDE.

Now you're ready to code a sketch that communicates with the DSP in real time to control its algorithm using [Aida DSP official Arduino API library](https://github.com/AidaDSP/AidaDSP/tree/master/Software/Libraries).

Basically you can manage your UI (user interface: buttons, faders, etc.) with Arduino and then let the DSP do the whole hard work of processing audio with superb quality. For example you can use the DSP to generate a sine tone and change its frequency and amplitude with a pot wired to Arduino's analog input. Check out our [examples](https://github.com/AidaDSP/AidaDSP/tree/master/Software/Examples) on Github!

### Typical applications
